# Interactive-Web-Map
The project aims to develop an Interactive Web Map that transcends traditional map interactions. It's not about merely marking a favorite place on Google Maps; it's about leveraging spatial technologies to provide a rich, immersive experience. By doing so, we emphasize the pivotal role of these technologies in enhancing user engagement with geographical data.
